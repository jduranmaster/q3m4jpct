#summary Getting started with q3m4jpct.

= Running the demo in Eclipse =
  # Check out the code as a project in the workspace
  # If you aren't using [http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org the m2eclipse plugin] you'll have to manually add `lib/jpct/jpct.jar` to the project classpath
  # Right click `Demo.java` in `q3m4jpct/src/test/java` and select _Run as > Java Application_

= Running the demo via Maven =
For the moment running the demo is bound to the _exec:java_ goal:
{{{
mvn exec:java
}}}



= Loading an animated player model =
Load the model from the default resource path (`/res/q3/models/players/...`):
{{{
Q3Player player = new Q3Player("tankgirl");
}}}
Set the upper and lower animation sequence:
{{{
player.setUpperSequence(AniCfgQ3Upper.STAND);           
player.setLowerSequence(AniCfgQ3Lower.IDLE);
}}}
Add the model to a jPCT world:
{{{
player.addTo(world);
}}}
Add the model to the scene root:
{{{
sceneRoot.addChild(player);
}}}
Configure the camera to look at the model:
{{{
world.getCamera().setPosition(100, 0, 0);
world.getCamera().lookAt(player.getTransformedCenter());
}}}
That's it.

In order for the animation to play you will need to continuously update the model in your main rendering loop:
{{{
player.aniTick(System.currentTimeMillis());
}}}
