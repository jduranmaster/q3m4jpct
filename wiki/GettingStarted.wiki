#summary Getting started with q3m4jpct.

= Introduction =
The q3m4jpct project adds support for loading [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena Quake III] models to [http://www.jpct.net the jPCT 3D engine].

= Loading an animated player model =
Load the model from the default resource path (_/res/q3/models/players/..._):
{{{
Q3Player player = new Q3Player("tankgirl");
}}}
Set the upper and lower animation sequence:
{{{
player.setUpperSequence(AniCfgQ3Upper.STAND);           
player.setLowerSequence(AniCfgQ3Lower.IDLE);
}}}
Add the model to a jPCT world:
{{{
player.addTo(world);
}}}
Add the model to the scene root:
{{{
sceneRoot.addChild(player);
}}}
Configure the camera to look at the model:
{{{
world.getCamera().setPosition(100, 0, 0);
world.getCamera().lookAt(player.getTransformedCenter());
}}}
That's it.

In order for the animation to play you will need to continuously update the model in your main rendering loop:
{{{
player.aniTick(System.currentTimeMillis());
}}}
