Didn't really have time to tidy up the .tgas, so the actual files look a bit messy, but the
skin's not too bad.  Not perfect, but Wrath needed some skins, so I thought I'd get this 
one done ASAP.

A personal vision really... fishnet... goths... someone mentioned Punkchick on the Polycount 
UBB , and I like to please.  Not too strictly TG, but then not too far off.

Everythings from scratch, it's my first released Q3 skin (if it gets released :( ).  

Can't wait to see the model on the streets!

BTW TinTin... geddit?  The bra?  Nevermind...
