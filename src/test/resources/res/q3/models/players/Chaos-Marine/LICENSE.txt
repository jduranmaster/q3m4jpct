Model description       : A Chaos Space Marine from the Warhammer 40,000 
Universe developed by Games Workshop.

Chaos Space Marines are bloodthirsy warriors who once fought for humanity,
but turned to the dark Chaos Gods during the Horus Heresy. Now they fight
a never ending war to destroy that which they once helped to build.

There are four of the Chaos legions represented in this model, The Black Legion,
The Iron Warriors, The Night Lords and the Word Bearers. The skins were mostly
built using the surface baker function in Lightwave, combined with bump, colour
and specular maps. Note that this is my first Q3 model...
