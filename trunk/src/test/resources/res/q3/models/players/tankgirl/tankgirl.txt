Thanks to:		Gutboy, Psychodroid, & Matthew "M@tthi@§" Mella for doing skins.
			NPherno for being such a great lay and being so good with tools.
			NPherno's mom...for pretty much the same reasons.

Author(s) notes:	This model was built, mapped, and animated in about a week.  I put the model up on my
			site and posted a message at www.polycount.com asking for intersted parties to do skins
			for her.
			After about a month, I hadn't gotten anything back.  Gutboy came forward and volunteered to
			skin her, and he sent me a finished skin less than a week later.
			Since then, there have been a couple of skins that managed to leak in at the last second...both
			of which are top notch efforts and happily addeded to the default flavor.

			I'm still hoping that this model might fulfill my life long fantasy of releasing a player model
			that gets 2 bajillion skins done for it by the community. ;)
